# Description
This is a multifunctional discord bot based on Open Ai that is able to chat and create images according to your description.The chat it makes is based on davinci-text-3 and the image is created from DALL-E.
Actually, there have already existed some kinds of bots like that but they contain some bugs or flaws which might prevent the bot from working properly.
PS: Indeed, I'm really a green hand of promgraming. It was not until I ran across Open Ai and fell in love with it that I step my first pace into programming. When I tried to build the bot based on Open Ai api, I found myself knew nothing about it so I just googled tuitions and attempted to simply copy the code. However, I felt at a loss when being faced with error reports which was all gobbledegook to me. As a result, I tried to understand the code myself. Luckily, with the help of Chat GPT, I soon grasped some basic elements so I was able to make comparisons among the codes found on the Internet. By trial and error, I solved all the problems I met and additonally, I made some improvement on them. Consequently, the bot was born.
